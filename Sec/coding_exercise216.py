# Consider a simple number compression algorithm that works as follows:

# 111155522500 -> '1....5...2..5.0..'

# The algorithm goes from left to right through the number and returns an object of str type. Each encountered digit is stored along with the number of dots - the number of times the given digit repeats until it encounters the next, different digit in the number.

# Implement a function called compress() that compresses number as described above.

# Examples:

# [IN]: compress(1000040000)

# [OUT]: '1.0....4.0....'

# [IN]: compress(20000000)

# [OUT]: '2.0.......'

# [IN]: compress(123456)

# [OUT]: '1.2.3.4.5.6.'

# Tip: You can use the itertools built-in module and the groupby class in your solution.

# You just need to implement the function. The  tests run several test cases to validate the solution.
